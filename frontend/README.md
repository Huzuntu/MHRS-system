# MhrsUmut 

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.4. 
The pages are almost the same as the current MHRS system, but I made them from scratch.
It is only front-end as of now, but I will update the functionalities as I go along.

## Description

The MHRS-system is designed to streamline the process of scheduling and managing medical appointments. It offers features such as user registration, appointment booking, and a user-friendly interface for both patients and medical staff.
